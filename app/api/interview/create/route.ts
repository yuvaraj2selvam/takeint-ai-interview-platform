            The questions are going to be read by a voice assistant so do not use "/" or "*" or any other special characters which might break the voice assistant.
            IMPORTANT:
            - Output must be a raw JSON array of strings.
            - Do NOT include any markdown, code blocks, or triple backticks.
            - Do NOT include any introductory or explanatory text.
            - Do NOT escape characters like \n or use \\.
            - Output format must be:
            ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]

            This will be read by a voice assistant, so:
            - Avoid using any special characters like /, *, \\, backticks, or quotes inside questions.
            - Do not prefix items with numbers or dashes.
            - Output must be valid JSON, directly parsable by JSON.parse().
